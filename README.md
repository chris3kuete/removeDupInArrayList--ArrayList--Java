# removeDupInArrayList--ArrayList--Java
remove duplicate in ArrayList

This project creates an original Array List and a while loop to input 10 integers 
then creates a new  ArrayList and uses a Foreach Loop to iterate through the original Array 
and an if conditional statement to find numbers that are not already in the new ArrayList
to populate it
